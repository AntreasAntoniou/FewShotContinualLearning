# Benchmarks for Continual Few-Shot Learning in Pytorch
The original code for the paper ["Benchmarks for Continual Few-Shot Learning"]().

## Introduction

Welcome to the code repository of *Benchmarks for Continual Few-Shot Learning*. This repository includes code for training 
Low-End and High-End MAML++ as well as SCA and ProtoNets on continual few-shot learning tasks. We also provide data providers and the datasets for both Omniglot and SlimageNet. By using this codebase you agree to the terms 
and conditions in the LICENSE file.

## Installation

The code uses Pytorch to run, along with many other smaller packages. To take care of everything at once, we recommend 
using the conda package management library. More specifically, 
[miniconda3](https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh), as it is lightweight and fast to install.
If you have an existing miniconda3 installation please start at step 3. 
If you want to  install both conda and the required packages, please run:
 1. ```wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh```
 2. Go through the installation.
 3. Activate conda using ```conda activate```
 4. conda create -n pytorch_env python=3.6.
 5. conda activate pytorch_env
 6. At this stage you need to choose which version of pytorch you need by visiting [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
 7. Choose and install the pytorch variant of your choice using the conda commands.
 8. Then run ```bash install.sh```

To execute an installation script simply run:
```bash <installation_file_name>```


## Datasets
We provide functionality for both SlimageNet and Omniglot. We have automated the unzipping and usage of the datasets, all one needs to do is download them from:

- [SlimageNet repository](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qQCoGoEJKUCQkk8roncWH7rhPN7aMfBr/view?usp=sharing)
- [Omniglot part_1](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot/blob/master/python/images_background.zip)
- [Omniglot part_2](https://github.com/brendenlake/omniglot/blob/master/python/images_evaluation.zip)

Once downloaded, please place them in the datasets folder in this repo. The rest will be done automagically when you 
run an experiment.

For **Omniglot**, unzip the two folders and mix their contents into a single folder which should then be placed under the 
datasets folder.

**Note**: By downloading and using the SlimageNet dataset, you accept terms and conditions found in [imagenet_license.md](https://github.com//FewShotContinualLearning/blob/master/imagenet_license.md) 

#### Other Datasets:
We provide a mechanism for quick and easy training of models on any image-based datasets. 
Read the data.py description in the [Code Overview](#code-overview) Section for details on how to train models on your own datasets.  

## Code Overview:

- datasets folder: Contains the dataset pbzip files and folders containing the images in a structure readable by the 
custom data provider.
- experiments_config: Contains configuration files for each and every experiment listed in the experiments script folder.
All of the scripts are automatically generated using the script_generation_tools/generate_configs.py script.
- experiment_scripts: Contains scripts that can reproduce every results in the paper. Each script is easily runnable
simply by executing:
```bash <experiment-script.sh>```
- experiment_template_config: Contains the template configuration files. These files have variables declared in their 
files indicated as $variable_name$, which are then filled automatically by the generate_configs.py script. This way one
can vary various hyperparameters automatically.
- script_generation_tools: Contains scripts and template files for the automatic generation of experiment scripts.
- utils: Contains utilities for dataset extraction, parser argument extraction and storage of statistics and others.
- data.py: Contains the data providers for the few shot meta learning task generation. The data provider is agnostic
to dataset, which means it can be used with any dataset. Most importantly, it can only scan and use datasets when they 
are presented in a specific format. The two formats that the data provider can read are:
1. A folder structure where the top level folders are the classes and the contained images of each folders, the images 
of that class, as illustrated below:
```
Dataset
    ||______
    |       |
 class_0 class_1 ... class_N
    |       |___________________
    |                           |
samples for class_0    samples for class_1
```
In this case the data provider will split the data into 3 sets, train, val and test using the train_val_test_split 
variable found in the experiment_config files. However, in the case where you have a pre-split dataset, such 
as mini_imagenet, you can instead use:
2. A folder structure where the higher level folders indicate the set (i.e. train, val, test), the mid level folders 
(i.e. the folders within a particular set) indicate the class and the images within each class indicate the images of 
that class.
```
Dataset
    ||
 ___||_________
|       |     |
Train   Val  Test
|_________________________
    |       |            |
 class_0 class_1 ... class_N
    |       |___________________
    |                           |
samples for class_0    samples for class_1
```
- experiment_builder.py: Builds an experiment ready to train and evaluate your meta learning models. It supports automatic
checkpoining and even fault-tolerant code. If your script is killed for whatever reason, you can simply rerun the script.
It will find where it was before it was killed and continue onwards towards convergence!

- few_shot_learning_system.py: Contains the meta_learning_system class which is where most of MAML and MAML++ are actually
implemented. It takes care of inner and outer loop optimization, checkpointing, reloading and statistics generation, as 
well as setting the rng seeds in pytorch.

- meta_neural_network_architectures: Contains new pytorch layers which are capable of utilizing either internal 
parameter or externally passed parameters. This is very useful in a meta-learning setting where inner-loop update 
steps are applied on the internal parameters. By allowing layers to receive weight which they will only use for the 
current inference phase, one can easily build various meta-learning models, which require inner_loop optimization 
without havin to reload the internal parameters at every step. Essentially at the technical level, the meta-layers 
forward prop looks like:
```python
def forward(x, weights=None):

    if weights is not None:
        out = layer(x, weights)
    else:
        out = layer(x, self.parameters)
    return out

```
If we pass weights to it, then the layer/model will use those to do inference, otherwise it will use its internal 
parameters. Doing so allows a model like MAML to be build very easily. At the first step, use weights=None and for any
subsequent step just pass the new inner loop/dynamic weights to the network.

- standard_neural_network_architectures: A module containing an array of neural network architectures that do not 
utlize inner loop optimization.

- train_continual_learning_few_shot_system.py: A very minimal script that combines the data provider with a meta learning system and sends them
 to the experiment builder to run an experiment. Also takes care of automated extraction of data if they are not 
 available in a folder structure.

# Running an experiment

To run an experiment from the paper on Omniglot:
1. Activate your conda environment ```conda activate pytorch_env```
2. cd experiment_scripts
3. Find which experiment you want to run.
4. ```bash experiment_script.sh```


To run an experiment from the paper on Mini-Imagenet:
1. Activate your conda environment ```conda activate pytorch_meta_learning_env```
2. Download the SlimageNet64 dataset from the [SlimageNet64 repository]()
3. copy the .pbzip file in datasets
4. cd experiment_scripts
5. Find which experiment you want to run.
6. ```bash experiment_script.sh```

To run a custom/new experiment on any dataset:
1. Activate your conda environment ```conda activate pytorch_env```
2. Make sure your data is in datasets/ in a folder structure the data provider can read.
3. cd experiment_template_config
4. Find an experiment close to what you want to do and open its config file.
5. For example let's take an omniglot experiment on maml++. Make changes to the hyperparameters such that your 
experiment takes form. Note that the variables in $<variable>$ are hyperparameters automatically filled by the config
generation script. If you add any new of those, you'll have to change the generate_configs.py file in order to tell it
what to fill those with.
